<!-- when you need to change data you use method
but when you need to change presentation of exciting data you will use computed property -->

<!-- computed property -->
<!--
commputed values are very valuable for manipulating data that exists on your Vue. Whenever you want to filter or transform your data, typically you will use a computed value for that purpose. -->
<!-- they are very handy to manuplating data that already exsits they are cached based
it mean that function run only once until the value dont change again
large calculation dont wont to return every time  -->

<!-- example method and computed
a=1
b=2
c=a+b
in method it run a,b, then c
but in computed it run only c because its a cached based -->

<!-- watcher -->
<!-- allow you to listen data object and run whenever a specific property change -->
